1.1-> Digital electronics,   which
 is used in everything from watches to computers, it is concerned with electrical 
systems mad up of a series of switches


1.2->walter brattain, who worked at bell laboratories, was one of three inventors 
of the transistor

1.3->a bit, which is short for binary digit, is a single unit of information

1.4->lithium batteries, which are often used in cameras, are used in watches and many
electronics displays

1.5->leds, which means light-emitting diodes, is an important component of some semiconductors

1.6->ohm,volta, and ampere, who were pionners in the study of electricity,
are remembered in the basic units of electricity
